# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Running the following commands will help run this next js file aka nft marketplace

```shell
npm install
npx next dev

```
if u wish to change the smart contract aka the backend , u need to run the following commands

```shell
npx hardhat compile

```
